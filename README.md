# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews with BERT

## Project Overview

Welcome to the academic research repository dedicated to "NLP Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews with BERT" conducted at the University of Science, Vietnam National University (VNU). This project employs advanced Natural Language Processing techniques, specifically leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to conduct sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. The repository contains comprehensive documentation, code implementations, and analysis results.

## Repository Contents

- **[Report.pdf](Report.pdf):** This document encapsulates a detailed research methodology, sophisticated analyses, and insightful findings derived from the sentiment analysis project.

- **[app.py](app.py):** The Python script provided in this repository implements a web application, enabling real-time sentiment analysis on user-inputted IMDB movie reviews.

- **[train_eval.ipynb](train_eval.ipynb):** This Jupyter Notebook file serves as the primary source for the code used in training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model, utilizing the powerful BERT framework.

## Repository Structure

The repository maintains a structured organization:

- [**README.md**](README.md): This document serves as a detailed guide to the project, its academic context, and the functionality of each component.
